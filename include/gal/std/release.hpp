/** @todo ways to implement hierarchy of calls to base members
 * (ex. when actor is released, we want to call derived member as well as several base class members)
 * 
 * 1. call base class members from inside derived call
 *     bad: lots of extra code in form of calls to base class members
 *          considering number of derived classes there will be, will probably make mistaken
 *          and forget to call a base member somewhere
 * 
 * 2. signals: every base and derived member subscribes to a boost::signal in the top-most class
 *      bad: probably very slow
 *           could forget to connect a method (though less code to maintain than in option 1)
 *
 * 
 * 3. crazy template inheritance (see c-testing/inheritance/multi_virt)
 *     bad: confusing, therefore probably hard to maintain
 *          MULTIPLE INHERITANCE OF DIFFERENT TEMPLATE VERSIONS OF BASE CLASS
